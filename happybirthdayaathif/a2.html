     <p id="p1"> A pain, one, two, three, four, </p>
    <p>a heart thats bent and broke before,</p>
    <p>a tear, one, two, three, four,</p>
    <p>an eye thats rained its secrets sore</p>
    <br>
   <p> a dream, one, two, three,</p>
    <p>a demon waging war in me,</p>
   <p> a scream, one, two, three,</p>
    <p>fear so blinding, i cant see</p>
    <br>
    <p>a cut, one, two,</p>
    <p>but all wounds heal when i'm with you,</p>
    <p>a drop of blood, one, two,</p>
    <p>but what can drain me if you knew?</p>
    <br>
    <p>a brother, one,
    <p>my sole beacon and the beacon of my soul,</p>
    <p>for all my life i'll stand by you,</p>
    <p>till the sun stops rising, the moon too,</p>
    <p>till the ocean stands and storms ensue,</p>
    <p>till this ground cries and these clouds shake,</p>
    <p>till no sense does this world make,</p>
    <p>till the bird does swim and the fish does fly,</p>
    <p>or maybe just until i die.</p>
    <br>
   <p> but should that be the end for me,</p>
   <p> i pray that you'll remember three,</p>
   <p> my smile for one, it tried so hard,</p>
   <p> no matter how broken, every shard,</p>
   <p> my voice for two, it gave its all,</p>
   <p> the last you heard it your name call,</p>
   <p> my name for three, let it ring,</p>
   <p> let songs of joy your heart sing,</p>
   <p> at the thought of me when i have gone,</p>
   <p> but have no doubt my brother, none.</p>
    <br>
    <p>for the truth is i may slowly fade,</p>
    <p>but even in such sleep i'll be your aid,</p>
    <p>for if you wish, i'll never die,</p>
    <p>i will always be up in your sky,</p>
    <p>and when you look right up and you see me,</p>
    <p>remember nothing but that three,</p>
    <p>remember nothing, remember me,</p>
   <p> let yourself have time to heal,</p>
    <p> but dont let time those memories steal.</p>
    <br>
    <p>and when you visit, i'll hear you come,</p>
    <p>that will mean life as i know it, or that and some,</p>
    <p>for in life or in death you are my brother,</p>
    <p>at best or at worst we fought together.</p>
    <br>
    <p>my palpability will be immersed in sand,</p>
    <p>but hold some tightly in your hand,</p>
    <p>and in life or in death you are my safety,</p>
    <p>at best or at worst you gave me plenty.</p>
    <br>
    <p>three, three, three,</p>
    <p>three words i beg you to hear me,</p>
    <p>and remember this for when its true,</p>
   <p> remember brother, i love you.</p>
