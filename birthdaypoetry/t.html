     <p id="p1"> Twenty-two years in this world done, </p>
     <p> twenty-two years of struggle and fun,</p>
    <p>twenty-two years on the pursuit of knowledge,</p>
    <p>twenty-two years i must acknowledge,</p>
    <p>kinda makes you a boomer in my eyes,</p>
    <p>but i digress, no time for lies.</p>
    <br>
   <p>the value of time, a joke before,</p>
    <p>a joke before you calmed the war,</p>
    <p>the internal war that raged on forth,</p>
    <p>reducing human to a swarth,</p>
    <p>one i couldn't calm alone,</p>
   <p> 'cause one of us had to claim the throne.</p>
    <br>
   <p> like vengeful wolves of rival packs,</p>
   <p> waiting for foe to turn their backs,</p>
   <p> digging their claws into their enemy's hinds,</p>
   <p> escaping to the left of their right minds,</p>
   <p> dejected at loss they walk away,</p>
  <p>  but slowly their own thoughts begin to prey,</p>
   <p> on the very side they'd fought for,</p>
   <p> their own thoughts they so abhor. </p>
    <br>
   <p> so the question posed, one of its kind,</p>
    <p>are the enemies on the border or is the enemy inside? </p>
   <p> a twisting case of vrais and faux,</p>
    <p>an answer leaving you in awe,</p>
    <p>but in the end it did not matter,</p>
   <p> for rescue came along to shatter,</p>
   <p> the resentment hid behind the battle.</p>
   <br>
   <p> rescue came along to rattle,</p>
   <p> the heart and mind of the growling wolf,</p>
   <p> a feeling of safety threatening to engulf,</p>
  <p>  the pack in whole, not just a few,</p>
  <p>  that rescue in the form of you.</p>
