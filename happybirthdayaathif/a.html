     <p id="p1"> A loud thud does sound, </p>
     <p> a little stiff body on the ground,</p> 
     <p> a cry for help amidst the night,</p>
     <p> a caterwaul: "let's make this right" </p>
     <br>
     <p> alas they're only silent screams,</p>
     <p> for help does only come in dreams, </p>
     <p> but is that not what makes this right? </p>
     <p> shining armour with no knight...</p>
    <br>
    <p> you see yourself but a normal man,</p>
    <p> maybe one with a cracked up hand,</p>
    <p> maybe on the outside looking in,</p>
    <p> with a thousand stories marked on skin.</p>
    <br>
    <p> but i see you better, i promise you,</p>
    <p> for you are one to see me through,</p>
    <p> the only one with eyes so true,</p>
    <p> the one who came to my rescue,</p>
    <p> for i've sunk and sunk but never drowned,</p>
    <p> but still no breath of air i found,</p>
    <p> my lungs deflate for one last time,</p>
    <p> the hour of death does play its chime,</p>
    <p> and I let go of all I know,</p>
    <p> but life you never let me throw,</p>
    <p> I fell to the seabed, not long left,</p>
    <p> but you held on, a legal theft,</p>
    <p> a silent saviour, is that not it?</p>
    <p> is that not you, does the shoe not fit?</p>
    <br>
    <p>I see you better, I promise you,</p>
    <p>those piercing eyes I watch them chew,</p>
    <p>right past the walls I built so high,</p>
    <p>straight to my lungs to drain them dry,</p>
    <p>awake I come, still in your arms,</p>
    <p>away you spin me in your charms,</p>
    <p>a hundred deaths passed but one-o-one,</p>
    <p>is a different journey I've begun.</p>
    <br>
    <p>the perfect laugh starts to shake,</p>
    <p>the joys within me right awake,</p>
    <p>for only one sound will wake me up,</p>
    <p>like a lightning bolt in me struck,</p>
    <p>the sound of your voice, soft and tender,</p>
    <p>who knew you'd be myself's first mender?</p>
    <br>
    <p>but beyond that is what you are,</p>
    <p>you are in my sky the shining star,</p>
    <p>never to die, never goodbye,</p>
    <p>never to be seen in another sky,</p>
    <p>a wet seed in the soil of life I was,</p>
    <p>never allowed to grow because,</p>
    <p>of all the loves that have passed me by,</p>
    <p>some too strong, some too dry,</p>
    <p>a raging storm within my sky,</p>
    <p>could never let me grow too high,</p>
    <p>a careful drizzle rains on me,</p>
    <p>never enough to set me free,</p>
    <p>so what did i need? unknown to me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>until you rowed in on your bright grey clouds,</p>
    <p>my little sky now in a shroud,</p>
    <p>the perfect storm, not fast not slow,</p>
    <p>the perfect storm for me to grow,</p>
    <p>but somehow the sun still shines through,</p>
    <p>no surprise, the sun is you,</p>
    <p>the shining star in my sky,</p>
    <p>the shining star for all of time.</p>
    <br>
    <p>hold my hand and we'll brave this together,</p>
    <p>hand in hand, together forever,</p>
    <p>a story to hear and a story to tell,</p>
    <p>infinite stories until farewell.</p>
    <br>
    <p>the perfect grey is now in sight,</p>
    <p>because nothing right is black or white,</p>
    <p>another lesson yet to learn,</p>
    <p>another joy yet to earn,</p>
    <p>but i see you now, is that not right?</p>
    <p>does the shoe not fit, a little tight?</p>

    <p>that's okay, a lesson learned,</p>
    <p>nothing is perfect, all is flawed,</p>
    <p>all but you, for you have earned,</p>
    <p>perfect, perfect, to be called.</p>
