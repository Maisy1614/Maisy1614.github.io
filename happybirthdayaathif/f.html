     <p id="p1"> Forever and always by your side, </p>
     <p>I'll walk beside you every stride,</p>
     <p>a quest i hope you do not mind,</p>
     <p>a quest with which together we'll find,</p>
     <p>completion in the life we live,</p>
     <p> and you'll have everything I can give.</p>
     <br>
     <p>people come and go they say,</p>
     <p>but i don't really think that way,</p>
     <p>i care for few and love few less,</p>
     <p>it's just who i am i guess.</p>
     <br>
     <p>but one thing i hold so close to heart,</p>
     <p>something i've valued from the start:</p>
     <p>my family, by blood and choice,</p>
     <p>those who recognise the quivers in my voice,</p>
     <p>those who see through the mask i hold,</p>
     <p>those who bring me warmth in cold.</p>
     <br>
    <p> of that, you, my family,</p>
    <p> this is our reality,</p>
    <p> despite potential brutality,</p>
    <p> or a sense of inhumanity,</p>
    <p> misunderstood triviality,</p>
    <p> underestimated calamity,</p>
    <p> beginning to end and back again,</p>
    <p> you'll always have that one small friend,</p>
    <p> waiting at the threshold of that one small home,</p>
    <p> pur home in the middle of the world we roam.</p>
     <br>
    <p> forever and always at that door,</p>
    <p> forever and always, forever and more,</p>
    <p> you've looked back to see them glare up at you,</p>
    <p> but you looked to the side, no one in view,</p>
    <p> today look beside you and you will see,</p>
    <p> that one small friend, that which is me. </p>
