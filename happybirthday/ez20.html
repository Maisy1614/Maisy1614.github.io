        <h3> THE BIG QUESTION 19 </h3>
        <p> The morning QuoComm was made was a wild ride in so many ways, one of the most distinct of them is being in a VC with cows in the background. I remember you went on the trip just because you weren't sure if you could cook anything, so Cowie of you. But regardless, amidst the chaos, it's easy to forget the day it was. On your birthday I ask you, when is QuoComm's? </p>
