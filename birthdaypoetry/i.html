     <p id="p1"> I'll sit here and I'll wait for you, </p>
    <p> I hear you cry, but I'm here too,</p>
    <p> you'll never have to shed a tear,</p>
    <p> that i wont wipe away, my dear. </p>
     <br>
    <p> i'll hold you close and keep you safe,</p>
    <p> our feelings come in every shape,</p>
    <p> but they'll all real so pass the gin,</p>
    <p> a high like no other for a time so dim.</p>
     <br>
    <p> a heavy cloud is storming by,</p>
    <p> across your world and across mine,</p>
    <p> i see your silhouette at this road's end,</p>
    <p> i pray that when it's passed you'll be here again.</p>
     <br>
    <p> you hid your pain for far too long,</p>
    <p> but still all that hurt has made you strong,</p>
    <p> but you walk away to be alone,</p>
    <p> all they see is a man of stone,</p>
    <p> never did they stop to ask,</p>
    <p> never did they doubt the mask,</p>
    <p> a facade more real than what it hides,</p>
    <p> at least in everyone else's eyes,</p>
    <p> they want to believe the pain you've endured,</p>
   <p>  they want to be where you can rest assured,</p>
    <p> but people lie, they tell their tales,</p>
    <p> and they drive their truths right off its rails,</p>
    <p> expecting the same from someone else,</p>
    <p> to reduce the low of their daily dwells.</p>
     <br>
    <p> but i'll sit here and i'll wait for you,</p>
    <p> i hear you scream, but i'm here too,</p>
    <p> i'll keep you safe ever and for,</p>
    <p> i'll heal the scars where people tore,</p>
    <p> through the person you built up to be,</p>
   <p>  the person who understands every part of me,</p>
    <p> you've fought one too many battles on your own,</p>
    <p> please don't leave for I hope I've shown,</p>
    <p> that no matter what you'll find me here,</p>
    <p> and you'll never have to shed a tear,</p>
    <p> that i won't wipe away my dear,</p>
    <p> from today on there is no fear,</p>
    <p> today marks just one more year.</p>
     <br>
    <p> another year you've fought so hard,</p>
    <p> i'll be the home to let down the guard,</p>
    <p> no more experiences to be marred,</p>
    <p> by circumstances that leave us scarred,</p>
    <p> together always, you say to me,</p>
    <p> thank you for you've set me free,</p>
    <p> so many years for us to see,</p>
    <p> but no matter what,</p>
    <p> it's you and me.</p>
