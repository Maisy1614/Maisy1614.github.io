            <p> As much as I wanna say I did the most I could for this, getting sick and uni getting in the way of the time I had free kind of made me a little short for time, despite me starting to plan this back before my birthday in August. I wanted to give you something special and the plan was this, and a few other things we can talk about that I just didn't manage to make happen and I'm sorry for that bro. </p>
            <br>
            <p> All in all, you mean the world to me Ashford. You've always kept me safe and always kept me happy no matter the circumstances since we've met, and if I could give you the whole world it'd still never be enough. Wherever we go from here, I'll always be there for you and I'll always keep you safe and happy, just as you deserve to be. </p>
            <br>
            <p> You have a checkered past and memories you may never want to relive, but it's the present that matters and you'll always have me by your side. You'll never be alone again because to me, you are so much more than someone who fought, someone who learned, someone who spoke or an absolute spaz- you are so much more than your mistakes and your successes. You teach me, you learn with me, you laugh with me, you guide me, reassure me, protect me, understand me and you make me feel special. That being only the briefest summary of the impact you have on my life. You are Aathif and I am so lucky to have you in my life. </p>
            <p> Thank you for existing, bro. I love you and happy birthday ❤️ </p>
