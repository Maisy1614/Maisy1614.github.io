        <h1> <span class="trost">Happy Birthday Aathif!</span> </h1>
        </div>

        <p> I know this isn't the type of shit you want on your birthday, but I just needed a way to show you how important you are to me without me being physically there to celebrate this day with you. I appreciate you so much everyday and your birthday is nothing more special than every other day we share together, but it's a special day to me because it's the day you existed as a smol Aathif and if that never happened, I wouldn't have big best Aathif in my life today. </p>
        <br>
        <p> I didn't want to overdo it but I did wanna do something, so this will be simple but hopefully enough to prove to you what you mean to me- although I hope my actions in everyday life do that for me as that is way more important than a birthday present, I just think it'd be gay for me to not celebrate AathifDay hehe üî™</p>

        <p> Press on each letter of your name below, and each button will show you something I wrote with you in mind. Some you may have seen before, some maybe not. I know you say you like my poems, and I just hope you enjoy these ones too. </p>
        <p> They do be for you ‚ù§Ô∏è </p>
