 <div class="container text2">
     <p id="p1"> Here's a story to be told, </p>
   <p> for all the years till you grow old,</p>
   <p> you may already be on that path,</p>
   <p> but i'll save that now and avoid your wrath. </p>
   <p id="p5"> (dont kill me lmao bye) </p>
    <br>
   <p> the story starts on separate ends,</p>
   <p> two journeys laced with matching trends,</p>
   <p> so very different they both are,</p>
   <p> so very different, so very far.</p>
    <br><p>
  <p>  one side lay on the hot red sand,</p>
   <p> the other back arched with a pen in hand,</p>
   <p> distinct lives they never shared,</p>
   <p> but neither side was just prepared,</p>
  <p>  for great things happen when there's a clash,</p>
  <p>  and they came at them both with a constructive crash.</p>
    <br>
    <p>you realise when you think some more,</p>
    <p>the world had so much in its store,</p>
    <p>for the two people who never knew,</p>
    <p>whose perception of normal had grown askew,</p>
   <p> they both layed down and looked at the sky,</p>
    <p>miles away, they let out a sigh.</p>
    <br>
    <p>such distinct lives they both are,</p>
    <p>but with a shared sky, and the same stars,</p>
   <p> we are connected in more ways than one,</p>
   <p> we look to the east and see one sun. </p>
    <br>
    <p>it rises and sets our days on green,</p>
    <p>experiences never to be seen,</p>
    <p>by the other member of this pair,</p>
   <p> life would never treat this one fair,</p>
    <p>but like yin and yang and ai ran khar,</p>
    <p>that which is close was once too far,</p>
    <p>two forces in themselves so rare,</p>
    <p>together completion like a crown they wear.</p></p>
    <br>
    <p>i see the stars, they twinkle at me,</p>
    <p>and they twinkle at you, don't you see?</p>
   <p> but good or bad means null to me,</p>
   <p> the stars don't lie, i do agree,</p>
   <p> but the beauty of good is not all i see,</p>
   <p> it's about the forces when they take a fall,</p>
   <p> the forces when they try to call,</p>
  <p>  about me and you in a time of need,</p>
   <p> in a time where our hearts begin to bleed,</p>
  <p>  about the beauty in the mending of our scars,</p>
   <p> almost as beautiful as our stars.</p>
    <br>
   <p> our stars remain and so do i,</p>
   <p> please don't leave me here to die,</p>
   <p> let's stay as three, us and the sky,</p>
  <p>  and to the end of time i'll always try,</p>
   <p> to endlessly be there for you,</p>
   <p> a time of need? I'm with you too,</p>
   <p> a happy day today- forever,</p>
   <p> because we'll always be together.</p>
